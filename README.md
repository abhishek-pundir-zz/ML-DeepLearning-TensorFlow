# Machine-Learning
This repository is the collection of my study about machine learning concepts and neural network models and their implementation with TensorFlow. The repository contains the code files of the different neural network models, application and concepts including edge detection. I will further update the formatized index of the repository.
The code files are written in python. Currently the code files are named according to the lab sessions which i will update further to topic wise naming.
Along with code files, the result images are available.

To run the programs on the local system, TensorFlow and python are must to be installed.

# Machine-Learning Deep-Learning
This repository is the collection of machine learning concepts and neural network models and their implementation with TensorFlow. The repository contains the code files of the different neural network models, application and concepts including edge detection.
The code files are written in python. Along with code files, the result images are available.

To run the programs on the local system, TensorFlow and python are must to be pre-installed.

activation function: take in some input produce some output

1. step function: act on some threshold
		* used for two class classification
		* output either 0 or 1

2. sigmoid activation function: resemble "s" shape
		* 'squash' the inputs into bounded intervals(as output)(i.e group up the input)
		* handy when combining with other activation function(like Step function)
		* types: Logistic, HyperBolic, Tangent function

3. logistic function: used in logistic regression	1/(1+e^-x)
		* output: sigmoid in range (0,1)

4. Arctangent, hyperbolic tangent: based on tangent function
	* Arctangent: f(x) = tan^-1x; produce sigmoid over (-pi/2,pi/2)
	* no implementation in tensorflow

5. Tanh: Hyperbolic tangent (or TanH)
		* defined as: f(x) = [2/(1+e^-2x)] - 1
		* produce sigmoid over (-1,1)
		* most used among sigmoid

6. Linear Unit: combine step and sigmoid
		* based on Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
		* [-infinity, 0) - o/p: 0
		* [0, infinity) - o/p: x
